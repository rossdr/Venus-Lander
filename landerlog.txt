I didn't find a log so here we are 8/14/2025.

SLN sez I started this around 20 January 2020, and worked on it at least until the 25th. This was a DNF to the point I was discouraged from going further.
...yeah, even during COVID. (we weren't really looking at COVID then...)

But the maze-generators I'd done in July 2025 got me re-couraged.
I did more work 2-3 August 2025. 14 August: Fixed some monstrous bugs and did the landscapes. And an icon LOL.
15 August, fixed the thrusters, tweaked the constants. it's playable! so, where the GOLDMINE was at, day Two.
16 August, finished the game as such.

... we could also use sound.
